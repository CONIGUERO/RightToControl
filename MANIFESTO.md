1. "Any electronic device that can give its manufacturer full control of its software and hardware must give the same level of control, without restriction, to any legitimate owner of said device."

2. "The status of the device (whether "intact" or "modified by the owner") shall not be made public or in any way notified to the manufacturer or to the services that may use the device, unless explicitly authorised by the owner".

3. "No manufacturer, company, organization or agency shall disable, suspend, or otherwise refuse to provide a service to the device, if the reason for the disabling, suspension, or refusal to provide said service is, entirely or in part, the refusal of the owner to disclose the status (either "untouched" or "modified") of said device.

4. “All possible methods of remote control, updating, or otherwise modifying any instances and/or layers of the software on the device by the manufacturer, company or agency shall be disclosed to the owner of the device before purchase.”
